Software Development senior at Austin Community College actively seeking an internship where I can apply what I’ve learned in a bigger setting. I’m driven by a genuine curiosity for how systems work — whether it’s training a machine learning model, writing clean backend logic, or implementing new technologies. I enjoy the process of turning abstract ideas into practical, working code that solves real problems.
